<h1>Translator++</h1>

<p>I developed a translation application using Redux-Toolkit features. An application that has the feature of translating in 110 different languages. It has the ability to switch between preferred languages by pressing the change button. It has a responsive structure. It can also be used on phones and tablets./p>
